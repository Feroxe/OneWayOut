## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. **Set up Supabase** (required for auth and data):
   - Create a project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
   - In the Supabase dashboard, go to **SQL Editor** and run the migration in `supabase/migrations/20250217000000_initial_schema.sql`
   - Go to **Project Settings** → **API** and copy the project URL and anon (public) key
   - Create a `.env.local` file and add:
     ```
     NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co
     NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
     ```
   - (Optional) In **Authentication** → **Providers**, disable "Confirm email" if you want immediate sign-in without verification.

3. (Optional) Set up Google OAuth:
   - Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory
   - Get your Google OAuth Client ID from [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
   - Add the following to `.env.local`:
     ```
     NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id-here
     ```
   - **Steps to get Google Client ID:**
     1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
     2. Create a new project or select an existing one
     3. Enable Google+ API
     4. Go to **Credentials** → **Create Credentials** → **OAuth client ID**
     5. Choose "Web application"
     6. Add authorized JavaScript origins: `http://localhost:3000` (for development)
     7. Add authorized redirect URIs: `http://localhost:3000` (for development)
     8. Copy the Client ID and add it to `.env.local`
   - **Note:** Google login will only appear if the Client ID is configured. The app works fine without it using email/password authentication.

3. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## Data Storage

The app uses **Supabase** for authentication and data. User accounts, profiles, expenses, debts, assets, daily moods, and onboarding data are stored in Supabase with row-level security so each user only sees their own data. Set up a Supabase project and run the migration (see Getting Started) before using the app.
